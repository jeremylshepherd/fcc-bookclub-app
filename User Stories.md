# Manage a Book Trading Club

### Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: [Example Project](http://bookjump.herokuapp.com/) and deploy it to Heroku.

> Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit [Get set for Dynamic Web Applications](https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-dynamic-web-application-projects).

#### Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

- [x] User Story: I can view all books posted by every user.

- [x] User Story: I can add a new book.

- [x] User Story: I can update my settings to store my full name, city, and state.

- [x] User Story: I can propose a trade and wait for the other user to accept the trade.

> Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Heroku.
